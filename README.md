Projects about options

1: Used Binomial Tree to estimate American option value, obtained optimal exercise time and profit distribution

2: Implemented dynamic time-based and move-based Delta hedging strategy to an option, explored model parametersâ€™ effect on the P&L distribution and the effect of different realizations of real-world probability and risk-neutral world probability

3: Used Euler discretization, Milstein discretization and Mixing method to estimate implied volatility smiles in the Heston Model, used multiple control variates to lower the variance of estimated implied volatility
