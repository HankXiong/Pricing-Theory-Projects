Projects about options
1.Used Binomial Tree to estimate American option value, obtained optimal exercise time and profit distribution

2.Implemented time-based and move-based Delta hedging strategy to an option, explored parametersâ€™ effect on the P&L distribution and the effect of different realizations between real-world probability and risk-neutral world probability

3.Used Euler discretization, Milstein discretization and Conditional volatility method to estimate implied volatility smiles and its confidence intervals in the Heston Model, used multiple control variates to lower the variance

4.Derive the analytical expression of bond price in two-factor interest rate Varsicek model, used simulation to prove the result and draw the yield term structure; determined the fair swap-rate of interest rate swaption, estimated Black implied volatility in the assumed log-nomal swap-rate framework
